**ExpressJS**
 1) What is Express.js?
 
    Ans. A backend framework of Node.js. It has lot's of built in configuration and it provides the very simple way to connect any middleware to your project.
    
 2) What is the purpose of it with Node.js?
 
    Ans. In ExpressJS we don't have to repeat same code over and over again. Node.js is a low-level I/O mechanism which has 
    an HTTP module. If we just use an HTTP module, a lot of work like parsing the payload, cookies, storing sessions
    (in memory or in Redis), selecting the right route pattern based on regular expressions will have to be re-implemented.
    With Express.js we will get the built in library/methods to do this with simplicity.
