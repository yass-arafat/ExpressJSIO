**ExpressJS**
 1) What is Express.js?
 
    Ans. A backend framework of Node.js. it's built around configuration and granular simplicity of Connect middleware.
    
 2) What is the purpose of it with Node.js?
 
    Ans. That you don't have to repeat same code over and over again. Node.js is a low-level I/O mechanism which has 
    an HTTP module. If you just use an HTTP module, a lot of work like parsing the payload, cookies, storing sessions
    (in memory or in Redis), selecting the right route pattern based on regular expressions will have to be re-implemented.
    With Express.js it there for you to use.
